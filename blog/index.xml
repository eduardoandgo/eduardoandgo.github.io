      <description>Cathy O’Neil discusses the problems and ethics with using data science in her book Weapons of Math Destruction. In one chapter she discusses the U.S. News college ranking, it’s development, and it’s consequences. It was the choice of what was deemed important for a college to have in order for the student to succeed that I see as the problem. A problem with this is that people were trying to cheat the system and raise their score without really deserving it.</description>

      <description>I was looking through the /r/dataisbeautiful thread and the one that stood out the most was one where they posted a link to their website, Flickmatrix where combine Rotten Tomato, IDMb, Letterboxd, and Metacritic scores with what’s available on Netflix and Amazon Video.
I looked throughout the site to find a blurb about where the data was being collected from but I could not find anything. So, I went back to the thread and looked for a comment or such, and all that was explained was that they got the information from their respective website, but was not responding to the comments that were asking about how they were getting information from Netflix, which makes me think they might have been sneaking around.</description>
