      <description>For my project, I will be looking at the police data from each state in order to create an interactive web app. I have checked a couple of state websites and I have checked that I can get information from them by webscraping. As for the interface, I plan on having a a section where the user can choose which crimes care about less when looking for new places to live and the map will brighten up or change the shade of the color to show them which states would be the best fit.</description>
