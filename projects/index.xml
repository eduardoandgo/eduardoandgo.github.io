      <description>For my project, I will be looking at crime in Chicago, Illinois in 2018. The primary focus of this project is to try to predict if an arrest will happen as a result of the crime. The data is coming from the Chicago police department and was downloaded from this website. Originally the data set has crime information from 2001 to 2019, but I want to focus on the most recent full year, 2018.</description>

      <description>Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate the posterior distribution of a parameter of interest. We draw samples from the estimated posterior distribution in order to compute statistics from that distribution. The two main methods I have been looking at are the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the other is using Hamiltonian Dynamics.
The interactive web app&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to help understand the difference between the two methods. There is an introduction to Bayesian statistics, each method, and then three examples.</description>
