      <description>For my project, I will be looking at crime in Chicago, Illinois in 2018. The primary focus of this project is to try to predict if an arrest will happen as a result of the crime. The data is coming from the Chicago police department and was downloaded from this website. Originally the data set has crime information from 2001 to 2019, but I want to focus on the most recent full year, 2018.</description>
