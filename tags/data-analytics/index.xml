      <description>Data analytics takes a lot of time. You have to clean the dataset, figure out what&amp;rsquo;s what and start thinking about which variables are going to help you answer your question. This should lead to some data exploration. You need to get a feel of what you are working with so that you can decide how to approach your question with what you have (or you find what your missing and try to aggregate it).</description>
