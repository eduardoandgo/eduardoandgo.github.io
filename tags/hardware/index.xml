I looked throughout the site to find a blurb about where the data was being collected from but I could not find anything. So, I went back to the thread and looked for a comment or such, and all that was explained was that they got the information from their respective website, but was not responding to the comments that were asking about how they were getting information from Netflix, which makes me think they might have been sneaking around.</description>
